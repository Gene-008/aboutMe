    <p>I've defined my life by bringing technology to sports in pursuit of excellence.  
      Within the past 10 years, an explosion of data has left those like me forever intrigued with what could be
    found within the rubble.  Mathematical & statistical tools like regression and linear algebra
    coupled with computer programming languages like Python and R have been my method of choice to excavate for insights.

      <a href="Thesis Poster REVISED 2.pdf" target="_blank"> Undergraduate Thesis: Reduced Dynamic Visual Capture in Monocular Viewing (2015)</a> 
      <br>
      <br>
      Binocular viewing requires disparity - differences in visual input by the natural distance of the eyes are resolved by the brain to provide a sense of depthness.  A baseball thrown from person A to person B is an object that looms towards person B and recedes from person A;
    correspondingly, the auditory effects the ball makes as it travels increases to person B and decreases away from person A.  Here, these conditions are in <i>congruency</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      In our experimental condition, <i>incongruency </i> occurs when an object looms (recedes) yet auditorily decreases (increases) representing 
      an biased relationship in how our human auditory-visual systems have originally biologically evolved.  Here, we hypothesized that in individuals with monocular viewing (that is, one eye closed or surgically removed) 
      would have a harder time accurately discriminating between the direction of the baseball and asked to accurately provide the modal selection because of a lack of binocular disparity, as explained earlier.
  </p>
<p>We found no significant statistical evidence to reject our null hypothesis.  This is encouraging because it highlights how evolutionary pressures have shaped our biological auditory & visual systems but more importantly our ability to adapt.
